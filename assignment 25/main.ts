//Question 25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

let aliens_color = "green";
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if(aliens_color === "green") {
     console.log("The Player just earned 5 points.\n");
}
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
if(aliens_color === "red") {
  console.log("The Player just earned 5 points.");

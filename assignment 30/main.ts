//Question 30: Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

let usernames: string[] = ["admin", "user1", "user2", "user3", "user4"];

usernames.forEach(username => {
    if (username === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    } else {
        console.log(`Hello ${username}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
});

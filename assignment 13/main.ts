//13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


let cars: string [] = ["Honda city" , "Honda Insight" , "Honda Accord" , "Civic"];
cars.forEach (cars => {
console.log(`I would like to own a ${cars}.`)
}

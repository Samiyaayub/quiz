//Question12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let personName: string [] = ['Jack', 'Milo', 'Emre'];
personName.forEach (personName =>{
    console.log(`Hello Dear! ${personName}.`)
}
    )
